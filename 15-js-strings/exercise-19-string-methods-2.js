/**
 * I've provided you with a word variable, set to "skateboard". 
 * Your goal is to use string methods on word, so that you end up with the string "beard"
 * 1- Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard"  (using the slice method)
 * 2- Replace the "o" in board with an "e" (using the replace method)
 * 3- Save the result in a variable called facialHair
 * 
 * This is another exercise that is very easy to cheat! I can't verify that you actually call the correct string methods.  
 * You could just copy and paste the answer into the variable. 
 * 
 *  BUT IF YOU DO THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE GUILT.  IT WILL TEAR YOU APART FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE! 
 * 
 * So, please follow the spirit of the exercise :)
