/**
    global Think of this as like window but for Node.js. DON'T ABUSE IT!

    __dirname This global is a String value that points the the directory name of the file it's used in.

    __filename Like __dirname, it too is relative to the file it's written in. A String value that points the the file name.

    process A swiss army knife global. An Object that contains all the context you need about the current program being executed. Things from env vars, to what machine you're on.

    exports module require These globals are used for creating and exposing modules throughout your app. We'll get to modules in a second ðŸŒˆ
